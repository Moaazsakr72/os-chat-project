Demo plan (1-2 minutes each):

1) Sockets system:
- Start server: ./server
- Open 2 clients: ./client (enter server IP, nick A, nick B)
- Type "hello" from A -> show B receives "[A] hello"
- Show server terminal logs.

2) Shared memory system:
- Start reader: ./reader
- Start writer: ./writer (enter nick)
- Send messages; show they appear on reader.
- Show that multiple writer processes can be started.

Finish: Quick comparison: sockets over network, shared memory on same host; semaphores prevent races.
